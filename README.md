### About me
My name is Vladislav Konyaev, in October 2021 I've started discovering data analysis. Previously, I was engaged in data analysis within the framework of real estate.
To deepen my knowledge in analysis, I've taken several online courses, that helped me to master Python, SQL, mathematical statistics, probability theory, product metrics and frameworks for product development. On academic projects, I practiced conducting statistical tests, creating dashboards in Tableau and Superset, using GIT and AIRFLOW.
